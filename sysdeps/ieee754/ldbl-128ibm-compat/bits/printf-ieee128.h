/* XXX: DO NOT COMMIT.

   On powerpc64le, the implementation of long double with IEEE binary128
   format is not complete.  The redirections of the printf.h functions
   are supposed to be implemented in bits/printf-ldbl.h, however, we can
   only redirect all or none.  In the meantime, bits/printf-ieee128.h
   allows us to redirect part of them for testing purposes.  */
